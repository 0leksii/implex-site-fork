    <p>You will be working at the https://www.admit.me product. The project is aimed to help an applicant applying to college: we propose the only automated profile review for full-time MBA candidates. By analyzing the many factors used in admissions decisions across six primary areas, it conducts a detailed review of a candidate’s profile. At its core, the score is a numerical representation of the strength of your candidacy, scored out of 1000.</p>

<p>The platform is released not only on it’s own site, but for other institutions (Emory, Georgetown, Economist, Foster). The nearest steps are to develop the analogous versions for Part-time MBA and Executive MBA and roll-out them on different school sites.</p>
